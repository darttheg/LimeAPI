### Release 1.0.0-beta.1
<h5>Posted August 7th, 2025</h5>  
This beta release reorganizes some module functions and reworks the window for better general functionality.

* Added [Lime.GetVersion][lime] retrieves the version of Lime running.
* Moved some [World][world] functions to [Lime][lime]:  
      * [Lime.GetFrameRate][lime]
      * [Lime.SetFrameRate][lime]
      * [Lime.GetMemoryUsage][lime]
* Reworked [Lime.SetWindowSize][lime] to work post-window creation, resizes from center.
* Added [Lime.SetMatchResolutionToSize][lime] which enables/disables matching the Irrlicht rendering resolution to the window size on resizing, defaulting to `true`.
* Maximizing the Lime window now fully covers the screen, with the top bar and task bar hidden.
* Added [Lime.SetAutoAspectRatio][input], which locks the window's aspect ratio on resize if enabled.
* Added [Input.GetMouseDelta][input], which returns the *physical* change in mouse position since the last frame, disregarding Input.SetMousePosition.
