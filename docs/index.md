# Welcome
Welcome to the documentation of **Lime Engine**, a 2D and 3D game engine powered by [Irrlicht](https://irrlicht.sourceforge.io/) and [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).

---

## Getting Started
Lime is driven by [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), a powerful lightweight scripting language.  
Visit these resources to learn more before diving into Lime:

* [Lua 5.1 API](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/)
* [Programming in Lua](https://lua.org/pil/)
* [Lua User Tutorials](http://lua-users.org/wiki/TutorialDirectory)

With Lua under your belt, you are ready to dive into Lime.  
Use the **sidebar** to navigate the API.
